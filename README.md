# Efficient Circuit-based PSI via Cuckoo Hashing

The proof-of-concept implementation of our PSI-CAT protocol based on 2D Cuckoo hashing developed as part of our EUROCRYPT'18 paper [Efficient Circuit-based PSI via Cuckoo Hashing
](https://encrypto.de/papers/PSWW18.pdf) is available as an example in the [ABY repository](https://github.com/encryptogroup/ABY/tree/public/src/examples/psi_2D_CH).
